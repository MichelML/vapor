Coveo UI StyleGuide
===================

Coveo StyleGuide is a collection of UI components used in Coveo's Cloud Services administration console. All components and their documentation is [available here](http://coveo.github.io/styleguide/)

It is widely inspired by [Bootstrap 3.0](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) and borrows some of its components.

The project is at its early stages, some components can still have _lots_ of breaking changes.


# Compiling
Make sure you have Node JS and NPM installed.
Run `npm install` to get the required dependencies.

### Styleguide

To compile the whole styleguide, run `npm run styleguide`.
The compiled styleguide will be available in the `/styleguide` folder.

### Library

If you prefer simply referencing the generated styleguide in one of your project,
you can run `npm run compile` and retrieve the files in the `/target/package` folder.
