<!--
Commented because header is position fixed and it's annoying to render it in the Styleguide.
<div class="header flex">
    <div class="header-section mod-padded flex flex-center">
        [LOGO]
    </div>
    <div class="flex-auto"></div>
    <div class="header-section mod-padded flex flex-center">
        Section 1, mod-padded
    </div>
    <div class="header-section">
        Section 2
    </div>
</div>
-->
